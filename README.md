# TimeFrequency_analysis_EEG
Hands on math concepts and data-analysis techniques around Time-Frequency representations of EEG data

This code is intended to be a supplement to the presentation. It won't make much sense by itself. 
It's meant to have a "hand-on" approach on the following topics: 
- Math concepts (dot-product), Convolution, sine waves, gaussians
- Fourier Transform
- Morlet Wavelets and Time-Frequency 
- Real data 

Also, the following data (publicly available) will be analysed during the tutorial. 
Download them in advance and place them in a separate folder!
